Ingredients:
For the Pie Crust:

1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, chilled and diced
3 to 4 tablespoons ice water
For the Pumpkin Filling:

1 can (15 oz) pumpkin puree
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
2 large eggs
1 can (12 fl oz) evaporated milk
Instructions:
Making the Pie Crust:

In a large bowl, mix together the flour, salt, and sugar.
Add the chilled butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of ice water over the mixture at a time, mixing gently with a fork until the dough holds together when pinched.
Form the dough into a ball, then flatten into a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
After chilling, roll the dough out on a floured surface to fit a 9-inch pie plate.
Transfer the dough to the pie plate and trim the edges. Chill the pie shell while you make the filling.
Making the Pumpkin Filling:

Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).
In a large bowl, combine the pumpkin puree, sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves.
Beat the eggs lightly in a separate bowl and then add to the pumpkin mixture.
Gradually stir in the evaporated milk until well combined.
Pour the filling into the chilled pie shell.
Baking the Pie:

Bake at 425°F (220°C) for 15 minutes.
Reduce the temperature to 350°F (175°C) and continue baking for 40 to 50 minutes, or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
Cool on a wire rack for 2 hours. Serve immediately or refrigerate.
Optional:

Garnish with whipped cream before serving.
Tips:

Avoid overworking the dough to keep the crust flaky.
To prevent the crust from over-browning, you can cover the edges with strips of aluminum foil halfway through baking.
For a more robust spice flavor, you can add 1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg or allspice to the filling.
Enjoy your homemade pumpkin pie!
