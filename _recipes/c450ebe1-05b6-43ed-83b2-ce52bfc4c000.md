Ingredients:
For the Waffles:

2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
1 3/4 cups milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil or melted butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries (if using frozen, do not thaw)
Optional:

Extra blueberries for serving
Powdered sugar or maple syrup for serving
Butter for serving
Instructions:
Preheat your waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

Wet Ingredients: In another bowl, beat the eggs and then add the milk, vegetable oil (or melted butter), and vanilla extract. Mix well until combined.

Combine: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are okay.

Fold in Blueberries: Gently fold the blueberries into the batter, being careful not to overmix as this can turn the batter blue.

Cook the Waffles: Pour enough batter onto the preheated waffle iron to just cover the waffle grid. Close the lid and cook until the waffle is golden brown and crisp. This usually takes about 4-5 minutes, depending on your waffle iron.

Serve: Remove the waffle and serve hot with additional blueberries, a dusting of powdered sugar, or a drizzle of maple syrup and a dollop of butter, if desired.

Tips:
Do not open the waffle iron too early; it can cause the waffle to split and stick.
For extra fluffy waffles, separate the eggs. Add the yolks to the wet ingredients and beat the whites until stiff peaks form. Fold the beaten egg whites into the final batter just before cooking.
If you want to keep waffles warm as you cook them, preheat your oven to 200°F (95°C) and place the finished waffles on a baking sheet in the oven until you're ready to serve.
To prevent the batter from turning blue when using frozen blueberries, toss them with a little flour before folding them into the batter.
Enjoy your homemade blueberry waffles!
