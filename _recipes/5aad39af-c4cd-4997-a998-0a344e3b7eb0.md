Ingredients:
For the Raspberry Filling:

2 cups fresh raspberries (frozen can also be used, just thaw and drain them first)
1/4 cup granulated sugar (adjust to taste depending on the tartness of the berries)
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest (optional)
For the Strudels:

1 package (17.3 ounces) puff pastry, thawed according to package instructions
1 egg (for egg wash)
1 tablespoon water
For the Icing:

1 cup powdered sugar
1-2 tablespoons milk or cream
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Instructions:
Make the Raspberry Filling:

In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the raspberries, granulated sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and lemon zest.
Cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture comes to a boil and thickens. This should take about 5-7 minutes.
Once thickened, remove from heat and let it cool completely. The mixture will thicken further as it cools.
Prepare the Puff Pastry:

Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
Roll out the thawed puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. Cut each sheet into rectangles of your desired size (typically 4x3 inches).
Place half of the rectangles on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. These will be the bottoms of your strudels.
Assemble the Strudels:

Spoon a small amount of the cooled raspberry filling into the center of each puff pastry rectangle on the baking sheet, leaving a border around the edges.
In a small bowl, make an egg wash by beating the egg with 1 tablespoon of water.
Brush the edges of the pastry around the filling with the egg wash. This will help seal the strudels.
Place a second puff pastry rectangle on top of the filling and press the edges to seal. Use a fork to crimp the edges and ensure a good seal.
Brush the tops of the strudels with more egg wash for a golden finish.
Bake the Strudels:

Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the strudels are puffed and golden brown.
Remove from the oven and allow them to cool slightly on a wire rack.
Make the Icing:

While the strudels are cooling, whisk together powdered sugar, milk (or cream), and vanilla extract in a bowl until smooth. The icing should be thick but pourable. Adjust the consistency with more milk or powdered sugar if necessary.
Finish the Strudels:

Drizzle the icing over the slightly cooled strudels.
Serve:

Enjoy the strudels warm or at room temperature. If you want to reheat them later, just pop them in the toaster or oven for a few minutes.
And there you have it, homemade raspberry toaster strudels that are flaky, sweet, and bursting with berry flavor. Enjoy your delightful creation!
